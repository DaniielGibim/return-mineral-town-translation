These are NOT full recolor tilesheet alterations! These are just small edits to help some of the smaller terrain areas mesh in better with some of the popular recolors. They won't alter any building colors, just the grass and sand to help with the visuals.

Just drag and drop the contents of whichever recolor you use into the tilesheet folder and replace the tiles there!

Thank you!
